# 2048AI
Second machine learning problem of the course CS165A Fall 2021 – Artificial Intelligence an AI is developed, that plays the game 2048 (https://play2048.co/) with a search strategy for reaching the highest possible score. I decided to use the Minimax strategy with α-β-pruning.
Note: A game engine got provided through the class, this repo does not contain a simulation environment (though it is really quickly implemented with already given functions)
